about the project 

the idea was basically inspired by the concept of facebook and quora. I wanted to put the features of both websites on a 
single platform. And it should be exclusively built for engineers.

so here you can make friends and discuss the queries related to a particular subject.

the wesite is provided with the different topics where you can put questions . And anyone can give the answer to
your questions.

A chat box is provided where side by side you can chat with the different persons on that topic.

website also comprises the social networking features such as making friends .so that you can make your own group and dicuss your activities 

test portal is also provoded so that you can give the test and judge your performance

?? and yes goyal the final punch check out the website www.guideengineering.com :)
