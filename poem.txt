"When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
When the road you are trudging seems all uphill,
When the funds are low and the debts are high
When you want to smile, but you have to sigh,
When care is pressing you down a bit,
Rest if you must, but don’t you quit.

Life is queer with it’s twists and turns,
As everyone of us sometimes learns,
And many a failure turns about,
When he might have won had he struck it out,
Don’t give up though the pace seems slow,
You may succeed with another blow.

Success is failure turned inside out,
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,
And you never can how close you are,
It may be near when it seems so far,
So stick to the fight when you are hardest hit,
It’ when things seem worst,
You must not Quit !!!!!"
